Java boxhead - simplistic version (only need to add graphics)

Fully functioning game. Made for an Assignment in 2021.

All info:

Zombie: Does base damage to player. Rewards: 25 points
Devil Zombie: Does DOUBLE base damage to player. Rewards: 100 points

Each round another zombie is added and chases the player
at every 10th round another devil will continue to spawn

at round five lootboxes will have a chance to spawn based on the round number (Higher the round number the higher chance)

Lootboxes will contain either an Uzi, AR or Sniper. RNG will decide what you get

These guns will last until their ammo runs out, after this it will go back to the default pistol

Guns:

Pistol (Default):  Rate of fire: 15   Damage: 1

Uzi :              Rate of fire: 2    Damage: 0.75

AR  :              Rate of fire: 10   Damage: 2

Sniper:            Rate of fire: 25   Damage: 10

Once health runs out game over. 

Can chose to play again or new game+ which starts at round 20.

Improvements that could be made:

Recoil - The recoil added for all these guns works when at a certain distance. If you bring the mouse too close the bullets will spray all around the character.
Can be fixed by making it so the projectiles always aim a certain distance, this will make the recoil constant.
(Have a constant circle around the player and the closest point to mouseX & mouseY will be the target for the projectile to aim at)

Shooting & rate of fire - Holding to shoot is how it was originally planned to fire but since it goes by framecount you can sometimes miss a shot if you spam click.
